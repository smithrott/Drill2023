# Drill2023
Drill2023 dataset released by Prof. Qinghua Song's Lab from Shandong University. This is a dataset for high-performance drilling of titanium alloy containing drilling force, drilling bending moment, workpiece vibration, acoustic emission and tool wear data that can be used for tool wear monitoring researches.

# Dataset structure
The cutting data of the three tools are stored in folders named T1/T2/T3 respectively. Data of Each cutting in the dataset is stored as an independent CSV file. Each CSV file of cutting data contains data for 10 channels: Ax, Ay, Az, AE, Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My and Mz. Each cutting data corresponds to a tool wear value, and the wear values of all tools are saved in files named T1.csv/T2.csv/T3.csv.
